## Task 2: Car Price Prediction

Developed a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a car based on features such as fuel type, transmission, year, and more.

### What I Did
- Loaded and explored the dataset (`car data.csv`)
- Performed preprocessing using `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Built a `RandomForestRegressor` model
- Evaluated the model using R² Score

### Libraries Used
- pandas  
- sklearn (train_test_split, OneHotEncoder, make_column_transformer, RandomForestRegressor, r2_score)

---

## Objective
To analyze car attributes and estimate their selling price using regression techniques, allowing better market predictions for buyers and sellers.

---

## Files Included
- `ROSHINI_K__TASK_3_DATASCIENCE_OASIS.ipynb` – Colab notebook  
- `car data.csv` – Dataset used  
- Demonstration video uploaded on YouTube

---

## Note
This project was submitted as part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship (OIBSIP). All code was executed using Google Colab and the results were recorded as a demo.
